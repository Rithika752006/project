# Digital Wallet Application - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Design System (Hybrid of Stripe Dashboard + Material Design)

**Justification:** This is a utility-focused financial application where trust, clarity, and efficiency are paramount. Drawing inspiration from Stripe's clean dashboard aesthetic combined with Material Design's robust component patterns ensures a professional, trustworthy interface optimized for frequent financial transactions.

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Trust Through Clarity:** Every transaction, balance, and action must be immediately understandable
2. **Efficiency First:** Common actions (deposit, transfer) should be accessible within 1-2 clicks
3. **Information Hierarchy:** Financial data presented with clear visual weight and scannable layouts
4. **State Communication:** Transaction status, wallet type, and payment modes clearly differentiated
